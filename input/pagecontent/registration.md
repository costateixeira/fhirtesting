1. A Test Candidate (typically a system vendor) consults the Test Repository(?) to see what are the available functionalities or capabilities for which they can initiate or request testing. 
   * The Test Candidate may have this structured also in form of CapabilityStatements to allow some automatic matching

2. Test Candidate selects the capabilities that they intend to register to test

3. Test Candidate requests the Test Registration Forms/high-level plans. These are forms that prepare the vendor for testing and notably allow the vendor to optionally:
   * Submit assertions that are part of - or preconditions - for the overall testing.
   * Submit parameter values that will be used in testing e.g. `serverUrl` or `systemId`

4. Test Candidate fills Test Registration Forms.

5. Test Candidate submits the Test Registration to a test harness

6. The Test Plans are pushed to a test Repository. 

7. The test repository then gets updated. It will thus contain Test Plans for the different scopes / capabilities. These Test plans can be configured for each test run and for each vendor.
