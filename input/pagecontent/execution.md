1. A Test Monitor (or test initiator) selects the test(s)
2. The test monitor triggers the Test Harness to initiate the tests
3. The Test Harness begins by setting up environments and anything needed 


How does this work with test data?

OPTIONALLY

The Test Harness receives the test plan, configuration parameters AND the instruction to execute in one single request.
